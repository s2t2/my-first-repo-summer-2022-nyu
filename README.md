# My First Repo!

This is the README.md file. It uses the markdown language. The line above is a heading, starting with the # sign. Don't be confused that # means something different in .md and .py files.

We can make links like [this](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python).

And lists too:

  + Item 1
  + Item 2
  + Item 3

For more information about Markdown syntax, see the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
